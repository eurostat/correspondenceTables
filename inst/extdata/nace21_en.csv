"01","Crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities","A","IMPLEMENTATION RULE: In agriculture, one frequent situation where the breakdown of the value added presents difficulties is when, e.g. a unit produces grapes and manufactures wine from the own-produced grapes, or when it produces olives and manufactures oil from the own-produced olives. In these cases the most suitable proxy variable is the number of hours worked and applying it to these vertically integrated activities would generally lead to classification of the units under agriculture. In the same case for other agricultural products, units will be classified in agriculture by convention, in order to guarantee harmonised treatment.","This division also includes service activities incidental to agriculture, as well as hunting, trapping and related activities.","Agricultural activities exclude any subsequent processing of the agricultural products (classified under divisions 10, 11 and 12), beyond that needed to prepare them for the primary markets. The preparation of products for the primary markets is included here.  The division excludes field construction (e.g. agricultural land terracing, drainage, preparing rice paddies) classified in section F and buyers and cooperative associations engaged in the marketing of farm products classified in section G. Also excluded are landscape service activities, which are classified in class 81.30."
